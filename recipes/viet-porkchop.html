    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs porkchops(about 6 chops)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp MSG</li>
        <li>4 tbsp neutral cooking oil</li>
        <li>6 tbsp lemongrass, minced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp shallots, minced</li>
        <li>1 tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cucumber, sliced</li>
        <li>3 tbsp scallion & oil</li>
        <li>3 tbsp dipping fish sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse pork chops under running water and lightly scrub with salt. Pat dry with paper towels.</li>
        <li>Combine all marinade ingredients in a medium mixing bowl and stir to combine and dissolve sugar and MSG. Then add the Marinade Aromatics.</li>
        <li>Marinade the pork chops in a bowl or bag in the fridge for at least 3 hours, but ideally overnight.</li>
        <li>Remove the chops from the marinade and discard the extra liquid–you can keep the aromatics on that stuck to the chops though.</li>
        <li>Pan fry: 1-2 chops at a time on medium to medium high heat without crowding the pan. When done, the pork should read 145 °F using an instant read thermometer at the thickest part of the cut.</li>
